# mapTutor.cpp
--------------
This is a sample code for stl (standard template library) maps which are generally used to store a pair of values.
Always keep in mind few things:
	1. insert(pair<data_type1, data_type2,...>(val1, val2,.... 
	2. instead of insert we can use map_variable[val1] = val2 when 2 variable are available. 
	3. when repeated values of val1 comes, previous value of val2 will be overwritten.
